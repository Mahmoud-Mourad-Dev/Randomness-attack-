# Randomness-attack- 
## 1- What is Randomness?
run same code get diffirent result

## 2- what is Determinisitic System?
   * Same Input == Same Outbut
   * every node must agree on the same state
    
  ```solidity
 function test(uint256 a) public pure returns(uint256){
      return a*2;
   }          // same input same output
   
```

## 3- why we need randomness in web3
   * Games NFT (Non Fungible Tokens  ) [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721)  Choose Winner
   * 🏛️ DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization choose Member to Voting
   * AirDrops
   * Validatores , committes , nodes  proof of stake (ethereum2, polkadot ,Algorand)
   * Defi Decentralized Finance
